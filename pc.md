## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?




1. a version control system that can compare local code
 
2. git is like where you will make the changes to the code as in creating your own local branch and git hub 
is where you will send it to be reviewed or you will review otherss code changes.

3. We create a branch so we do not change the original code and create a new bug or mess us the original code we can go back to for refrence.

4. so first a pull request is what you will do when you have made all the changes and want to merge
the purpose of it is to let your boss or team member know you are ready for your work to be reviewed and merged

5. git checkout 

6. git fetch grabs the data, git pull also grabs the data but also merges it, git merge will merge the changes from our branch together with the code.

7. it is where git can't figure out the difference in the code between to different commits.

8. there are 3 ways you can fix a merge conflict, accept the local version, accept the remote version and or review the changes individually.

ps (i had no idea what a merge conflict was, had to look it up and figure it out xd)
